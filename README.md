2. Click on the clock icon to access the triggers, or use the menu to navigate to `Triggers`.
3. Click `+ Add Trigger` and configure it as follows:
   - **Function to run:** Select the function that generates and emails the profit analysis chart.
   - **Event source:** Time-driven.
   - **Type of time-based trigger:** Day timer.
